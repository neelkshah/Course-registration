# The Exponential Best Case  

+ Courses have complementary value, ie. students value a combination of courses and not individual courses. Therefore a complete profile of courses is taken as input instead of going through courses serially.
+ The best case scenario would be one where every student submitted 'n' complete timetables, and global welfare would be maximized over all possible combinations of timetables for all students.
+ However, the computation for this best case is exponential in nature (either space-wise or time-wise).
+ This directory has the code for a hypothetical scenario consisting of 32 students bidding for 4 different courses, with each student submitting two candidate timetables.
+ Even this simplified version of the problem requires roughly 5 hours of computation depending on hardware efficiency. (working in O(n) space).
